You lost me at bootstrap.
Amazing tutorial! You explain complex topics so clearly. This really helped me improve my React skills.
"Your a genius , a master of how to teach. Amazing !"
React seekhne k baad baal bhi nhi bachenge ky
Its so hard to follow along when your zoomed in so much.
it would have been great if you shared the code base on Github !
Loved ths Tutorial! Made a dumb person like me understand so much. Thank you very much!
I bought this full course this is really up to the mark no need to peep on other tuts after completing this course and it will make you a good programmer and start earning
I like fireship
the vite is not working like the website is not getting updated
"Programming with Mosh, You deserve more views!"

"how do I get the node you use there are different types  Prebuilt installer,  Prebuilt binaries and the rest so what do I do?"
Thankyou very much for this tutorial!
I liked this react course.  It was very accessible.  I would have liked it if you had expounded on the console errors and why they were happening and why it was ok to ignore them.
how do i run it in terminal
In react a componenet cannot return nore than one element
i never got node modules folder and i used the same version as you
it didnt even cinnect with the localhsot server
React or typescript??
I just dont know why my npm start does not work here? How do I open my app on the browser?
"This course is good to learn basic things, but as you said at the start of this tutorial, you have not built the demo app that you showed us and not even shared the source code of the app you have showed us."
I prefer if this course used Tailwind CSS instead of Bootstrap.
"After 1 year, I have time and am back to learn React.. Who else does the job for we old school programmers? Thanks bro"
Thankyou very much for such a great learning and quality content
Really amazing tutorial - I started without knowing how to use Typescript but it worked alright. Im now looking for more of your videos specially typescript cause im literally a newbie on that language.
Great course from great teacher! Mosh is the best! Looking forward for the next part.
It would be nice if you provided the github code so i dont have to meticulously follow along
So you spent all these time to create a button?
1 hour 20 minute to build a single button on react. do not waste your time on this tutorial. bro just funneling to his paid course

I love how you keep your code clean and explain every step as well as a few other ways to achieve the same goal. This helps a ton!
"Thank you Mosh, you are really good at teaching. I learned a lot from this tutorial and I like the extensions and shortcuts you recommend."
Thank you Mosh. Easy to follow tutorial as always!
Thank you.
"Thank you so much for this course, apt and very understandable"
Thank you verry much
Impressed with your style and presentation of teaching. I am pretty sure you can teach react to a grandmother as well.
"Sorry to say this. If you are teaching react js, specifically tell that you are teaching react js in typescript or javascript."
Thanks you made me fall in love with react. Love your presentation style but the intermissions are too long.
Thanks much!
Thanks MOsh

"Saw the thumbnail, clicked it, watched it. Found out the thumbnail was clickbait, wasted my time. Thanks Mosh!"

I like how react can return without all the if else statements but just with a simple return if something do not happen.
This feels so wrong
Yeah. Great
Are you some kind of teaching wizard? This is so satisfying to engage with. Thank you.

Very concise class! Good job!
Thank you!
The Mosh way of teaching! Great!
"Thank you, for beginner on react like this is helpful. I have one doubt on your comparison of Props and State. you said State is mutable, I think it is not if I am not mistaken. that is why states return the variable and set variable function to not directly mutate the variable, thank you"
"Thanks Mosh, it must be a great video!"

"Love watching it, very useful concepts explained in a best way."
He cheats viewers by giving the wrong msg in thumbnail saying all the content in one video .. and he tries to push users to buy his course for the rest of the contest... Although Mosh is a great lecture but at the same time misleading the thumbnail and wasting users time dear mosh please do not do this!

awesome Mosh. Your teaching style is concise and to the point. I am subscribed to a number of online IT learning resources but this is by far is the best intro to React that I went through.
"This was the most helpful thing in a while. Most you go thorugh the errors the same way we catch them. You dont just spoil the solution on why we are getting the error. So many times during this course when I got an error, I saw the hints that you gave and then tried to solve it on my own. Truly one of the best teachers!"
